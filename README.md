# Transformer-Based Diffusion Probabilistic Model to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of Lithium-ion batteries
**Problem:** With the rise of automation in the automotive industry, high-quality
processing of sensor data has become essential. An important area of research is
prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of batteries. Advanced machine
learning algorithms Transformer and Diffusion models are widely used to process
2D, 3D and time-series data. These models have produced excellent results,
ensuring the stable operation of automobiles in complex environments. The MDT
department at the Technical University of Berlin aims to use these models to
explore and improve battery life prediction capabilities to meet the demands of
today's automotive industry for superior sensor data processing quality.

**Task:** Retrieve existing models of algorithms for the processing of time series data
and existing models of algorithms for the battery RUL. Design experiments based
on controlled variables, i.e. using the same training and test sets. Develop
Transformer-based models combined with Diffusion for battery RUL prediction with
reference to the work of others and debug the algorithms based on existing
scenarios. Finally, this work will be compared and evaluated side-by-side with the
work of others.
The results of the research will be summarized and suggestions for further research
will be made.
